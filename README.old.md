# Archers-Clicky-Game

You are in the ‘Danger Zone!’ while playing Archers Clicky Game (per Archer himself). All of your favorite characters are here from Archer to Lana to the beloved Woodhouse in this interactive points based game.

## How to Play
Users click any character to start. The goal of the game is to only click each character once, with the highest top score achievable being 12. If you accidently click the same card twice, you loose and the game resets. The challenge is in that every time you make a guess, the characters will shuffle and reorganize. Keep track of your score by watching the right hand of the nav bar at the top of the page. The center of the nav bar gives you a message update on each guess as well as to whether you guessed right, wrong, or got them all correct! The link on the top left in the nav bar resets your score and re-loads the page.

## Feedback
React is awesome! The file structure is different from some of my other work so required some learning there, as well as syntactical differences from traditional JavaScript. I spent the most time on this project getting the characters to display properly and hooking up the point system. Happy with the end result and am ready to play a round while watching the show!
